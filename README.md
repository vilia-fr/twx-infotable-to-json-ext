# twx-infotable-to-json-ext

A trivial extension (33 lines of JavaScript code!) permitting you to use Expression
and Validator widgets for INFOTABLEs.

Using it is trivial too -- just drop it on your mashup and bind it like this:

`(Sertice) --[INFOTABLE]--> [Data](InfotableToJson)[Output] --[JSON]--> (Expression)`

This extension can serve as an example of a truly trivial, yet functional example.
It's a good starting point if you are new to authoring ThingWorx extensions.
